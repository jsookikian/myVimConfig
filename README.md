# myVimConfig

These are a few scripts to set up my personal vim configuration

I wrote a script to do this in python, c, and bash.

##Usage
#C version
''' bash
gcc setupVim.c -o setupVim
'''

Then run the executable
'''bash
./setupVim
'''

#Python Version
'''bash
python setupVim.py
'''

#Bash Version
'''bash
sh setupVim.sh
'''
